## Introduction

This is a collection of scripts for Figure 53's [**Qlab**](https://qlab.app/) show control software. I started out working with scripts which have been shared freely online, and evolved into editing these scripts, and more recently creating brand new scripts to automate parts of my workflow.

In all scripts that I have adapted from publically available versions, I have credited the original author in the `@source` tag, in the header of the file.

Feel free to make any changes, modify things how they fit, ask questions, or post issues if you're having trouble getting things running on your system! I'll do my best to help you get it working for you!

Some scripts are meant for regular use while programming (such as level bumps, creating fades for cues, and creating mixing desk recall midi cues). Some scripts are intended for one-off use (such as creating line-check cues). A few scripts are very specifically designed for my workflow ("choose desk to program" and "speaker polarity check" specifically)
