--###EXPERIMENTAL###: this script was developed for a specific show, so may not be generally useful. If you click in the waveform of an Audio Cue and run the script it will attempt to load the entire sequence of nested cues you are in to that point in time: useful for choosing a cue point visually. It assumes the sequence hierarchy is entirely "Timeline" Group Cues, although it can cope with the parent of the selected cue being a "Start first child and go to next cue" Group Cue. The load time calculated is copied to the Clipboard for you to paste in next time.
